# me-plasma

This demo paints a canvas with a plasma fractal. It uses a simple
recursive formula to pick the color at each pixel. I made this
because I dreamed about the ancient Fractint program I used to
play with many years ago.

This has a quirk where the colors are not picked smoothly. It
almost looks like there are imbedded koch snowflakes in the plasma.
I left it as is because I think it looks cool.
